How to compile and run the game Lights Out:

1. Extract the files from the submitted zip file.

2. Open your Terminal/Console/Command prompt depending on your operating system.

3. Open the directory to the location that you extracted the files through the use of the Terminal/Console/Command 
   prompt mentioned above. The exact commands may differ based on your operating system and the location 
   in which you extracted the files. 

4. Once you are in the correct directory, enter: javac *.java

5. Once this is complete, enter: java Driver

6. Once the game opens, click on the squares to turn the lights on or off. The goal is to turn all of the lights off. 
   If you wish to restart the game, click on the New Game button, this will reset the game. If you manage to switch 
   off all of the lights, the game will congratulate you. Good luck, it is harder than it looks!
