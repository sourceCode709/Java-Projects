Compile/Run from a shell/cmd/terminal window:

1. Open shell/cmd/terminal depending on your OS.

2. Navigate to inside the Quoridor folder.

3. Type the following:
	javac *.java. 
   This creates the class files for the source code, runnable by the JVM.

4. To run the program, type the code:
	java -cp .. Quoridor.Driver
   This line tells the JVM to include the path to "Quoridor" package in its classpath
   system variable when executing the code in the Driver class file.

Remember to recompile the code if you edit it.
